## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Project Status     | All      | DCO sign-offs and licensing done for current services (State Estimation, Load Forecasting, Voltage Control) and tools (Real-time simulator, IEC61970, Grid Editor). John can add to LFE insights. Currently working on demos for LF Summer Summit (SE and VC), aim is to have services deployable with Helm Charts and Kubernetes (Helm Charts are in place). |
| Legal Documents    | All     | Trademark discussion status - Link from sogno-energy.eu (H2020) to LFE SOGNO, need to speak to Fiona Williams about this item. |
| Project Charter    | All     | Two points to discuss - license for future projects (Decided on Apache2), Mission Statement - SOGNO is creating plug-and-play, cloud-native, micro-services to implement our next generation of data-driven monitoring and control systems. TSC has approved the project charter. |
| Integration with LF FLEDGE Project | All     | Most applicable plugins to SOGNO (at present): Southbound plugins - IEC104, IEC61850, MQTT, OpenWeatherMap. Northbound - HTTP, IEC104. FledgePOWER, downstream poject of FLEDGE, idea is to develop plugins that are specific to power systems, with the aim to upstream these to FLEDGE.    |
| Guidelines for services/functions     | All     | Once demo is done, then bring in CI/Testing with aim to get badges. Data models & formats - CIM IEC61970 (CIMpy, CIM++), IEC61968 (PlatONE), IEC104 (LF FLEDGE), IEC61850 (LF FLEDGE), would need to build components to work with IEC61968, partial support in CIM++, nothing ready for this at the moment, but it is important as it is a DSO focused data format, important for SOGNO LFE as it is targeted primarily at the DSO, test with RTDS stack (after LF summer summit). Check with Data Architecture LFE working group - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QcHqPRSmUUJQlJnfygGDkOpDPlId6U1V22pBuvZvDYk/edit#heading=h.g0v5yhj0kiyj & https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/HOME/Data+Architecture+Working+Group . |
| Deployment | | Deployment - Kubernetes and helm charts/cofigs, new repo with example deployments available - https://github.com/sogno-platform/example-deployments . |
