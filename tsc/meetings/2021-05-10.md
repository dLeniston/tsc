## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Menti about topics to be discussed      | All  | TSC members can use this tool to add discussion topics to the agenda.      |
| Repos Added      | All  | More repositories added since last meeting, more documentation added for services as sub-documentation to avoid coupling with main SOGNO platform documentation area. Will explore sticking with adding specific documentation for services, keeping everything modular. Voltage Control repository added to GitHub.     |
| Reverse Proxy (WIT)      | WIT, RWTH  | Discussed methods explored with NGINX and experience that WIT have had in the past. Group agress that we should keep everything based in Kubernetes. Should services still have their own seprate namespace still? We should discuss this item. |
| Architecture diagram (one slide)      | RWTH  | Markus has re-done the Architecture diagram to make them a bit more detailed. One aim would be to make these diagrams interactive where a user can click on an element (e.g. RT-Simulation) and be taken to the repository. Could be done with SVG.      |
| Kafka & Strimzi      | All  | After summer summit RWTH had a discussion with Omicron. Strimzi is an open-source solution for Kafka on Kubernetes. Group in RWTH has some experience with Strimzi but it is not that easy to set up (Strimzi still in early development). SOGNO and FLEDGE integration with Kafka, if done, why not make this available to all projects? Needs further discussion as more projects seem interested in supporting Kafka, but from feedback with more experienced people, this is not an easy process.     |
| State-Estimation | RWTH | Plans to improving libraries (e.g. more versions which are more applicable to SOs), had a discussion with Tennet about collaboring on dynamic SE, nothing concrete yet but continuing the discussion. Next month should have more updates on this item. |
| New Design | All | Moving away from a current Service API implementation with poorly-maintained Python package, good time to re-do Service API methodology, allowing Service API to send request to message broker, which can then be forwarded to workers, providing more asynchronous operation. Will also provide more overal with another project being run in RWTH, so implementation work can be shared.  |
