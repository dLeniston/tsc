## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Additions to Agenda | All | No additions recommended |
| Notes Location |  All | No preference from partners for the location of notes. Markus is going to try out using the wiki.  |
| Project Status |  All | Many of the services/tools signed off, some are awaiting sign-off + relicensing. A few issues with contributions from outside sources regarding relicensing of work, these have been resolved. Licenses are a mix of MPL2 and Apache2, for new projects coming in, suggestion is that we aim for Apache2 license.  |
| Legal Documents | All | Project manager for SOGNO gave approval to use SOGNO trademark. Existing SOGNO domain currently in use, LFE would prefer to have ownership of this domain to avoid confusion between SOGNO EU and SOGNO LFE, current domain is owned by Ericsson. At the least there needs to be some indication on the existing SOGNO website that work is continuing via SOGNO LFE. |
| Guidelines for services/functions | All | Recommended interfaces between services - Should guidelines enforce services to support all chosen technologies? Each service should leverage one or two core protocols to ensure service interaction (e.g. HTTP/REST + MQTT). Data models & formats - Integration with LF FLEDGE, Investigate which FLEDGE plugins could be integrate with SOGNO services (e.g. openweathermap + load prediction). List of FLEDGE plugins updated regularly, grows rapidly. For streaming grid measurement data from field devices, some functionality for translating between protocols may make data easier for some services to digest. |
| Roadmap | All | Services - Plan is to start with State Estimation and Voltage Control services to provide K3s demos, SE has been proven in the field, SE & VC can be run with simulation. Partners agreed that we should prepare an example with FLEDGE integration. Documentation - We should create docs/API spec template for services |
