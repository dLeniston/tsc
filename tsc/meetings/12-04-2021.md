## Discussion Items
| Item | Who | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Orgranisation | All  | Project moving onto next stage (Early Adoption Stage). Some new repos have been set up, [helm chart repo](https://github.com/sogno-platform/helm-charts) and [example deployments](https://github.com/sogno-platform/example-deployments), containing scripts to easily set up some SOGNO services with helm charts. Now that the helm charts are in place, easier to add more services. |
| Integrations | All  | Questions about further integration with other LFE projects, for example [OperatorFabric](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/operatorfabric/). Integration of Kafka with Kubernetes is a challenge, there is a solution name [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/) which provides a way to run a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes. With Kafka support in place will allow for more integrations. Some tooling may not be free with Kafka, may need some investigating. |
| Reverse Proxy Implementation | All  | Next items to tackle before bringing in more services - Reverse Proxy, API Skeleton. Reverse Proxy - There may be some existing functionality for this in Kubernetes, or some other projects may do something similar, list of some [otions viewable here](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=service-proxy&grouping=category). |
| API Skeleton | All  | Aim for OpenAPI based specification. What would be shared between independent service APIs? If there are shared API specs, investigate a common place for these. This should serve as a place to start from. Suggestion to instead look at providing API guidelines to help steer how the service APIs should be defined, or could combine these where the guidelines reference a base OpenAPI specification. |
| AOB  | All  | Question of best practice to handle Asynchronous jobs, could be added to the API guidelines to outline common way to handle this. [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) |


## Action Items
| Item | Responsible | Due Date |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Review possible reverse proxy solutions (send ideas/feeback to Markus)   | All    | For next meeting |
| Review API management tools | All | For next meeting |
